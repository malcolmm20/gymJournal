# Gym Journal

## A openWorkout recording app to help you workoutExercise intelligently.

This application is designed to make tracking your workouts more efficient.  

Its features will include:
- Recording your workouts statistics
- Calculating your "one rep max" for exercises you have performed  
- Saving custom  workoutExercise routines 
 
Recording your workouts is important for every level of athlete. It helps 
set and achieve goals, and it is useful to consult your workoutExercise history
when designing new openWorkout routines. When I started working out, I
used a pen and paper, or the *Notes* app to record the weight, reps, and sets 
for every workoutExercise I performed. Unfortunately, this method proved to be time-
consuming and inefficient. With the ***Gym Journal*** application, users will
be able to record their exercises, save routines that they often repeat, and
view a calculated estimate of their one rep max for each workoutExercise that they have 
done.
